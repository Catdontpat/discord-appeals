Howdy partner! You may be approaching this repo and asking how could you use this? It's very simple!

Change the .env configure file with your bot token, client ID, the guild ID that the appeal bot will be managing, and the client secret for oauth2 reasons.
After doing so, Change the `MONGO_URL` To your mongo database, This is in order to manage appeals and to store cases for users for if you want to reduce the ban on users or any other related things.
